# Meteorological Forecasting App

A Flask-based application that generates weather forecasts for sensors located at meteorological stations across different cities. The app uses Celery for background task processing and PostgreSQL for data storage.

## Features

- Weather forecast generation for city-based sensor stations
- Background task processing with Celery and Redis
- PostgreSQL database for data persistence
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- Task monitoring with Flower dashboard

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL

## Installation

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd meteorological-app
```

2. Copy the DB environment and adapt to your configuration:
```bash
cp .env-db-local.example .env-db-local
```

3. Build and start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:
- Flask API on `http://localhost:5000`
- PostgreSQL database on port `5433`
- Redis for task queue
- Celery worker for background processing
- Flower dashboard on `http://localhost:5555`

### Local Development

1. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up DB environment variables:
```bash
cp .env-db-local .env
```

4. Start PostgreSQL and Redis services (or use Docker for just the databases):
```bash
docker-compose up db redis
```

## Database Setup

### Initialize and migrate the database, using tha make command:

```bash
# Initialize migration repository (first time only)
make db-init

# Create migration
make db-migrate -m "Initial migration"

# Apply migrations
make db-upgrade
```

### To reset the database, using tha make command
```bash
# Initialize migration repository (first time only)
make db-init

# Drop all the table

# Recreate the alembic_version table, pretending to be fixed
make db-stamp-head

# Truncate the alembic_version table

# Apply migrations
make db-upgrade
```

## Usage

### Start the application:

**With Docker:**
```bash
docker-compose up
```

**Local development:**
```bash
python app.py
```

### Access the services:

- API: `http://localhost:5000`
- Flower Dashboard: `http://localhost:5555`
